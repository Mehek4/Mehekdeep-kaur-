## Project Overview
This portfolio demonstrates my hands-on experience using **LetsDefend**, a cybersecurity blue-team platform. The project focuses on:

- **SIEM Log Analysis**
- Detection and response to suspicious activity
- Incident investigation and documentation

The portfolio showcases my ability to **apply theoretical knowledge to real-world cybersecurity scenarios**.

---

## Project Goals
- Investigate suspicious logins and system alerts.  
- Analyze events using SIEM tools.  
- Apply structured incident response procedures.  
- Document findings and reflect on learning outcomes.

---

## Methodology
1. Logged into LetsDefend using FedUni email.  
2. Selected the “SIEM Log Analysis” lab.  
3. Collected and filtered logs to identify anomalies.  
4. Correlated failed login attempts and suspicious events.  
5. Verified suspicious IPs using threat intelligence sources.  
6. Categorized incidents (e.g., brute-force, credential compromise).  
7. Documented steps and included screenshots for verification.

---

## Results
- Detected multiple failed logins followed by a successful login from a suspicious IP.  
- Incident classified as **credential compromise**.  
- Gained practical experience in SOC workflows, alert analysis, and incident reporting.
